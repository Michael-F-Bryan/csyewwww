WHAT FIREFIGHTERS ARE DOING

Services, Parks and Wildlife Service firefighters are attending.
Aerial support cannot operate in the dark and have been released from the incident. If needed they will return at first

personnel in the air and on the ground, and forces aircraft to be grounded or redirected, hindering firefighting
efforts.
